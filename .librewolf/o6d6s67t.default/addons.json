As you can see in WebExtensions API documentation or simplified tutorials, there's no way to apply any modifications to a web page without gaining the full access permission to that page. Stylus is mostly used to apply global themes, which is why it requests a global permission. In the future we might be able to implement a more granular approach but it's not exactly trivial.\n\n    Access your data for all websites - required for the style elements to be added into the page, not to access any of your data.\n    Access browser tabs - required to show styles in the popup, and for some auxiliary features like regexp tester in the editor.\n    Access browser activity during navigation - required to insert the styles at the exact moment the page is navigated to a different URL.\n    Identity - required for access to cloud services to allow importing and exporting of styles (e.g. Dropbox, etc).\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nUnlike other similar extensions, we don't find you to be all that interesting. Your questionable browsing history should remain between you and the NSA. Stylus collects nothing. Period.\n\n\nFirefox related notes\n\n    To import styles from Stylish add-on please read https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-export-my-user-styles-from-stylish-for-firefox-to-stylus\n    Stylus doesn't apply userstyles to the browser UI or the built-in pages like about:addons because there's no WebExtension API for dynamic application of CSS. You may use another extension that runs an externally installed companion utility to modify userChrome.css and userContent.css and restart Firefox. This restriction is imposed intentionally by Mozilla for security purposes. We don't plan to incorporate the above-mentioned workaround. See https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Styling-Firefox-UI\n    Export backups of your database frequently. The main reason we've kept the \"beta\" status for so long is because WebExtension support is still a work in progress for Firefox. Many Firefox specific workarounds have been implemented, but backing up your DB regularly will save you a lot of aggravation should something happen to go wrong.","weeklyDownloads":2900,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Stylus Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13438734/"},"developers":[{"name":"Jeremy Schomery","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11568224/"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/184/184539.png?modified=1622132703","width":700,"height":517,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184539.jpg?modified=1622132703","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":394,"caption":"Promo"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/184/184538.png?modified=1622132703","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184538.jpg?modified=1622132703","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Editor"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200986.png?modified=1622132705","width":843,"height":597,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200986.jpg?modified=1622132705","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":377,"caption":"Manager - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200987.png?modified=1622132709","width":970,"height":865,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200987.jpg?modified=1622132709","thumbnailWidth":449,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Editor - showing RegExp tester and colorpicker"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200985.png?modified=1622132711","width":538,"height":610,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200985.jpg?modified=1622132711","thumbnailWidth":353,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200988.png?modified=1622132713","width":576,"height":727,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200988.jpg?modified=1622132713","thumbnailWidth":317,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup - finding styles"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6724,"reviewCount":314,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/reviews/","updateDate":1707380293000},{"id":"extension@tabliss.io","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/850/850407-32.png?modified=1650892013","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/850/850407-64.png?modified=1650892013","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/850/850407-128.png?modified=1650892013"},"name":"Tabliss - New Tab","version":"2.6.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3940751/tabliss-2.6.0.xpi","homepageURL":"https://tabliss.io","supportURL":"https://tabliss.io/support.html","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabliss/","description":"A beautiful New Tab page with many customisable backgrounds and widgets that does not require any permissions.","fullDescription":"Transform your new tab page to something beautiful and yours.

The extension captures the area and tries to recognize text inside this region using the internal powerful OCR engine. This extension uses the \"tesseract.js\" library that supports more than 100 languages, automatic text orientation, and script detection.\n\nThis extension loads the JS library on the page and removes it when you are done with the OCR. This way there is no long-term resource usage.\n\nNote: On the first run, the extension might take a few minutes to fetch the training data from the internet. Since this resource is cached, all subsequent calls are going to be fast.\n\nNote: Optical character recognition (OCR) is slow, so this extension displays a progress bar for each detection module.\n\nNote: This extension does the OCR process offline. There is no server-side interaction. It only fetches the language training database once.\n\nNote: This tool can be used to extract the text content out of images, PDF documents, Powerpoint slides, or extract the content of a web page when user-section is forbidden.","weeklyDownloads":254,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Brian","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/15062319/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/256/256996.png?modified=1622137015","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/256/256996.jpg?modified=1622137015","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333}],"contributionURL":"https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/addondev/10usd?country.x=USD&utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":3.9565,"reviewCount":12,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ocr-image-reader/reviews/","updateDate":1700905235000},{"id":"{963aa3d4-c342-4dfe-872e-76be742d1bea}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-32.2b26add4b394.png","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-64.d144b50f2bb8.png","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-128.452018499894.png"},"name":"Disable YouTube Number Keyboard Shortcuts","version":"1.2","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4134869/youtube_disable_number_seek-1.2.xpi","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":"https://github.com/timmontague/youtube-disable-number-seek","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-disable-number-seek/","description":"Disables 0-9 keyboard shortcuts on YouTube which seek to different times on a video.","fullDescription":"This extension disables the 0-9 keyboard shortcuts on YouTube which seek to different times on a video.\n\nThe volume control keys on my laptop are directly above the numbers.
