## My Dotfiles:

This is my personal dotfiles configuration.

### Install:

To Start, simply clone the repo using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/SmallMing6675/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles/
```

An install script is already provided inside the install/install.sh
Note that the install script will only work with arch linux / arch based distros.
